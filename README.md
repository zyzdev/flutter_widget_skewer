# flutter_widget_skewer

A Dart code generator that lets you build Flutter widget trees using [method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface#JavaScript).  
No more [declarative UI](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/declarative) — just chain widgets like skewered food 🍢.

---

## ✨ Features

- Chain any widget constructor as an extension method
- Cleaner syntax, less boilerplate
- Supports both `Widget` and `List<Widget>`
- Works with most Flutter SDK widgets
- Type-safe, since everything is generated from Flutter SDK

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_widget_skewer:
```

Run build runner:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build

or

dart run build_runner build
```

Import generated extensions:

```dart
import 'package:YOUR_PACKAGE/gen/flutter_widget_skewer.g.dart'';
```

## 🛠 Usage

With `flutter_widget_skewer`, you can write:
```dart
    Text('Hello Widget')
        .container(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
            color: Colors.grey,
            alignment: Alignment.center)
        .opacity(opacity: 0.5)
        .rotatedBox(quarterTurns: 1)
        .card(margin: EdgeInsets.all(16), clipBehavior: Clip.antiAlias)
        .inkWell(onTap: () {}, focusNode: FocusNode())
        .ignorePointer(ignoring: false)
        .hero(tag: UniqueKey());
```

Instead of writing:

```dart
    Hero(
      tag: UniqueKey(),
      child: IgnorePointer(
        ignoring: false,
        child: InkWell(
          onTap: () {},
          focusNode: FocusNode(),
          child: Card(
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(16),
            clipBehavior: Clip.antiAlias,
            child: RotatedBox(
              quarterTurns: 1,
              child: Opacity(
                opacity: 0.5,
                child: Container(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
                  color: Colors.grey,
                  alignment: Alignment.center,
                  child: Text('Hello Widget'),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
```

Cleaner, flatter, easier to read.  
No more bracket hell 🎉

## ⛓️ Chaining with `List<Widget>`

`flutter_widget_skewer` not only supports chaining on a single `Widget`,  
but also on a `List<Widget>` — useful for constructors that take multiple children.  

For example:

```dart
final items = [
  Text('Item 1'),
  Text('Item 2'),
  Text('Item 3'),
];

/// Instead of:
Column(
  children: items,
);

/// You can chain directly:
items.column();
```

This also works with widgets that take `slivers`:

```dart
final slivers = [
  SliverAppBar(title: Text('Hello')),
  SliverList(delegate: SliverChildListDelegate([...]))
];

slivers.customScrollView();
```

👉 This makes it easy to go from a list of widgets straight into layout widgets without extra boilerplate.

## ⚠️ Limitations
Currently, the following widgets are not generated by `flutter_widget_skewer`:

- `CupertinoTextSelectionToolbar`
- `TextSelectionToolbar`
- `CupertinoScrollbar`

These widgets have unique constructor,  which make them technically difficult to support with the current generator.  

(They are not commonly used in widget composition, but if you need them, feel free to open an issue or contribute a PR!)
